		<p>
			By default, this script will normalize the input text to Unicode form NFC; trim outside
			whitespace; replace two annoying diacritics specific to the romanization of Persian (this can
			be disabled); remove any remaining combining diacritics (none should be present after NFC
			normalization); replace any unusual horizontal space character (including tab) with a normal
			space; reduce any instance of multiple spaces to one; remove any space before a line break;
			reduce any instance of multiple empty lines to one; and replace any non-breaking hyphen or
			figure dash with a normal hyphen.
		</p>
		<p>
			With “extras” enabled, this will further replace single or double curly quotes with their
			straight equivalents; and replace any en or em dash with two or three normal hyphens,
			respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			Naïve counts of characters, words, and paragraphs (where separated by an empty line) are given
			for the cleaned output text.
		</p>

			Other features may be added over time, as they occur to me. In any case, the source files are
